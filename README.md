# fracti.py
A rudimentary Python class/module to handle fractions.

I made it just for fun, but it actually turned out to be pretty useful. Still, I can't get the "displaying the fractions" part down, though I hope to do so in the future.

Until then, it's here.

# How to use
Just import it like a python module and have access to the fraction class and its methods and variables.
